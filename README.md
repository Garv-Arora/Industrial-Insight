### 📦 Project Lifecycle Breakdown

#### 1. **Planning & Design**
- Define objectives, user base, and use-cases
- Select tech stack (LLM, FastAPI, Docker, etc.)
- Design chatbot architecture and API contracts

#### 2. **Data Preparation**
- Gather domain PDFs, books, Wikipedia dumps
- Preprocess: Clean, chunk, embed
- Store embeddings in Pinecone / Weaviate

#### 3. **Chatbot Model Setup**
- Build using Langchain / Haystack + FastAPI
- Integrate fine-tuned OpenAI / LLaMA / HF model
- Add memory/context management

#### 4. **Backend API Development**
- FastAPI endpoints: `/chat`, `/train`, `/deploy`, `/logs`, `/metrics`
- Add OAuth2 / JWT-based RBAC (Auth0)
- Integrate error handling and logging

#### 5. **Frontend Development**
- Build UI using Next.js / React
- Add login, PDF upload, and real-time chat features
- Connect securely to backend APIs

#### 6. **Containerization & Infrastructure**
- Dockerize all services
- Write Helm charts for Kubernetes deployment
- Provision infra using Terraform (EKS/GKE)

#### 7. **CI/CD Automation**
- GitHub Actions for build + push
- ArgoCD / Flux for GitOps-style auto-deployments
- Rollback mechanism on failed deploys

#### 8. **Monitoring & Observability**
- Use Prometheus + Grafana for metrics
- ELK Stack or Loki for logs
- Sentry for error tracking

#### 9. **Security & Secrets Management**
- HTTPS with Cloudflare
- Store secrets in HashiCorp Vault / AWS Secrets Manager
- JWT-based access control

#### 10. **API Automation Layer**
| Action | Endpoint |
|--------|----------|
| Deploy version | `POST /deploy` |
| Upload PDF | `POST /train` |
| Rotate secrets | `POST /rotate-secrets` |
| Retrieve logs | `GET /logs?user_id=X` |
| Metrics view | `GET /metrics` |

#### 11. **Feedback Loop & Optimization**
- Collect real-user feedback
- Improve chatbot responses
- Retrain on new data → redeploy via CI/CD

#### 12. **Production-Readiness**
- Fully API-controlled lifecycle
- Independent microservices
- Monitored, secure, and scalable
- 99.9% uptime and rollback-ready

#### 13. **Bonus & Future Scope**
- Slack / Discord integration
